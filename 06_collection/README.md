### Basic Inventory Plugin

This is a demo inventory plugin, packaged as part of a collection.

How to package, from this folder:

```
ansible-galaxy collection build
```

You can upload this in the Ansible Galaxy UI!

If you actually use this, it will take the input `count` and make that
many hosts.
